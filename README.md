4.6. Count of Restaurant ID and Average Aggregate Rating by Cuisines:-
Key Findings:
The bar chart visualizes the number of restaurants serving various cuisines and their average 
ratings. North Indian cuisine is the most popular, served by 936 restaurants, but its average rating 
is relatively low at 1.67. North Indian and Chinese cuisine combinations are the second most 
popular, served by 511 restaurants with an average rating of 2.42. Additionally, the dataset 
includes other cuisines such as Italian, Continental, and Mexican, which vary in their popularity 
and customer satisfaction.
Conclusion: While North Indian cuisine dominates in availability, the low ratings suggest that 
improving quality and service could significantly boost customer satisfaction. The variety of other 
cuisines indicates opportunities to target niche markets with higher-rated offerings.

4.7. Online Delivery Services:-
Key Findings:
The analysis shows that only 25.66% of restaurants offer online delivery, while 74.34% do not. 
Despite the growing demand for online services, the majority of restaurants are yet to adopt this 
feature. Expanding online delivery could help restaurants tap into broader customer bases and 
stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry.
Conclusion: Online delivery represents a significant growth opportunity, allowing restaurants to 
enhance convenience and meet evolving customer expectations.

4.8. Table Booking Services:-
Key Findings:
Only 12.12% of restaurants provide table booking services, while 87.88% do not. This indicates 
that most restaurants may miss potential customers who prefer to reserve tables in advance. 
Incorporating table booking features could help restaurants attract more diners and improve 
overall customer satisfaction..
Conclusion: Table booking is an underutilized service that, if expanded, could improve customer 
experience and increase restaurant revenue.

4.9. Top 10 Countries with the Highest Average Restaurant Ratings:-
Key Findings:
The country with the highest average restaurant rating is the Philippines.

4.47. Other countries in the top 10 exhibit varying ratings, with some performing moderately 
and others below expectations. This suggests that countries with higher ratings prioritize quality 
and customer satisfaction, creating a benchmark for others.
Conclusion: The Philippines leads in customer satisfaction, setting an example for other countries 
to emulate. Countries with lower ratings have opportunities to adopt best practices and enhance 
their service quality.

4.10. Average Rating by City:-
Key Findings:
The city with the highest average rating is Inner City, with a remarkable score of 4.90, followed 
by Quezon City with a rating of 4.80. While some other cities also perform well, many fall below 
the 4.0 threshold. These findings highlight cities where restaurants excel in delivering exceptional 
customer experiences and where there is room for improvement.
Conclusion: Cities like Inner City and Quezon City set high standards for restaurant performance, 
showcasing the importance of quality and service in achieving customer satisfaction

5. CONCLUSION
This analysis of the Zomato dataset reveals key insights into the global restaurant industry. While North Indian 
cuisine is the most popular, its ratings highlight areas for improvement. The underutilization of online delivery 
and table booking services presents significant growth opportunities for restaurants. Countries and cities with 
high ratings, such as the Philippines and Inner City, set benchmarks for others to follow. By addressing these 
gaps and leveraging these insights, restaurants can enhance customer satisfaction, expand their reach, and 
improve their overall performance.
